				<p>Gutman has founded and supported multiple successful, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZSD4e8npAk'>mission-driven companies</a> and non-profit organizations that have <a href='https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/ron-gutman-i-am-really-focused-user'>helped</a> hundreds of <a href='https://www.weforum.org/agenda/authors/ron-gutman'>millions of people</a> around the world live happier healthier lives. As a scholar and advocate of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlLhwfrNAP0'>positivity</a> and smiling, Gutman wrote and presented a popular <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Smile-Astonishing-Powers-Simple-Kindle-ebook/dp/B006IS4WW0'>TED book</a> and <a href='https://www.ted.com/talks/ron_gutman_the_hidden_power_of_smiling'>talk on the Power of Smiling</a> that was translated to 53 languages and viewed by millions worldwide. As a lecturer at Stanford University, Gutman co-authored a leadership framework—<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymq2oygliGI'>Sapient Leadership</a>—to help leaders everywhere navigate the new reality of change that’s exponential, perpetual, and pervasive (<a href='https://hbr.org/2020/10/what-it-takes-to-lead-through-an-era-of-exponential-change'>3-D Change</a>). Gutman is the founder and first CEO of the Interactive Health company <a href='https://www.healthtap.com/'>HealthTap</a>. At HealthTap, he invented and led the development of <a href='https://fortune.com/2015/10/28/healthtap-hospital-operating-system/'>HOPES</a> (the first Health Operating System), <a href='https://fortune.com/2017/01/10/healthtap-dr-ai-launch/'>Dr. A.I.</a> (an artificial intelligence tool for symptom triage to information and care), <a href='https://hitconsultant.net/2017/02/20/healthtap-launches-voice-activated-doctor-amazons-alexa/'>Dr. A.I. on Alexa</a>, <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/20/mobile-medical-consultation-service-healthtap-launches-disaster-service-healthtap-sos/'>HealthTap SOS</a> (for disaster relief), <a href='https://www.mobihealthnews.com/22707/healthtap-takes-on-app-curation-prescribing'>AppRx</a>, and <a href='https://www.wired.com/2015/03/healthtap-raterx/'>RateRx</a>, <a href='https://www.mobihealthnews.com/26755/healthtap-launches-siri-like-app-hires-webmd-alum'>Talk to Docs</a>, and <a href='https://www.mobihealthnews.com/26755/healthtap-launches-siri-like-app-hires-webmd-alum'>DocNow</a> (the first <a href='https://www.fastcompany.com/3020791/why-go-to-the-doctor-when-you-can-talk-to-a-doctor-in-your-phone'>virtual health app on the Apple Watch</a>), amongst other inventions. He also designed and endowed <a href='https://hitconsultant.net/2018/01/03/healthtap-doctor-consultations/'>HealthTap for Good</a> to offer free online doctor consultations to people in need.
